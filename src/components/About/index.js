        I’m good as a problem-solver. During building a project, I get a lot of problems. I enjoy organizing them, and I try to solve them one by one until solving all. Also, I’m interested in studying new skills and a quick learner. Whenever I start a project, I should learn about new technology frequently, but I do not hesitate to learn it and use it.
